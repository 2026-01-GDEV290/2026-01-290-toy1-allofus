## Reasons to build a digital prototype

- **test out a mechanic**
- test out game feel
- **test out technology** (an engine feature)
- test the visual or audio aesthetic

Our concern for this is testing interactions that come from the verbs we listed.

## questions we are trying to answer

- can we implement this mechanic?
  - in code
  - with visual scripting
-   can we get the game engine to do what we want to do?
  - with keyboard
  - with mouse
  - with controller
  - with touch

This repo uses the Built In Rendering Pipeline.

## what is the end goal for this experiementation?

Can we come up with a unique verb or verbs to include in our final projects?
